Personal Assistance for Seniors Who Are Self-Reliant.

1.Sometimes elderly people forget to take their medicine at the correct time.

2.They also forget which medicine He / She should take at that particular time.

3.And it is difficult for doctors/caretakers to monitor the patients around the clock. To avoid this problem, this medicine reminder system is developed.

4.An app is built for the user (caretaker) which enables him to set the desired time and medicine. These details will be stored in the IBM Cloudant DB.
If the medicine time arrives the web application will send the medicine name to the IoT Device through the IBM IoT platform.

5.The device will receive the medicine name and notify the user with voice commands.
